Pivot_File can be loaded in CSV format directly into your Data Base Management System or can be used as an intermediate file between an e-CRF and another conceptual data model for example (FHIR, OMOP).

You can also implement the OSIRIS_CDM into your DBMS without using pivot files ; just using OSIRIS_MPD from last release OSIRIS_OFFICIEL.
